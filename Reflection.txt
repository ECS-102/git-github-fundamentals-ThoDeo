So far, I have learned the surface levels of working with GitHub. I have learned how to open repositories and connect certain IDEs and files to this repository. I've also learned how to push changes and the formal methods of writing comments on your changes. GitHub is extremely helpful for working on code in a team environment, allowing people to work on scripts separately and uploading them when they are fully complete.
